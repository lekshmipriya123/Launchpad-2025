About Me
Hi, I’m Lekshmi Priya A S , a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering  at ACE College of Engineering, Trivandrum.
I’m passionate about coding and how it’s reshaping the world. I enjoy blending tech with real life — whether it’s vibe coding or exploring how AI can be part of everyday experiences.
I’m a fast learner, always curious, and constantly looking for ways to level up my skills — especially in AI, app development, and building things that matter.
